# 3prr-planar-robot
Simulations based on the dynamic and kinematic model of a 3 degrees-of-freedom planar parallel robot to be used for rigid-body inertia-parameter identification. The goal of the project is to design and build a robot capable of attaining high frequency, low-amplitude 3-dimensional motion.
